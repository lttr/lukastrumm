_I have created a piece of software so awesomeâ€¦ It must be
hyper-awesome-app! Yes, naming is hard. Here is a list of truly awesome software
with only one mistake&mdash;they all contain the word "hyper", damned. How am I
supposed to google it?_

The word _hyper_ means something excessive, something extra or above.
I am wondering: isn't every new software great, super, hyper and
awesome? At least at some point or for someone.

Please, think twice before using word _hyper_ for **anything**.
