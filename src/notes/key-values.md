## Inspiration

keyvalues.com is a great website with a list of values that one might appreciate.

## My values

- Ownership and responsibility

  - When you own something you can actually improve it, because it's yours

- Open communication, open software

  - I like clear, constructive and open communication
  - I like when software is done similarly&mdash;it is open source and open to contribution (or at least internally)

- Friendly to people with needs

  - I need more time for my small kids, someone else need more money or something
  - Respect other people needs

- Focus on work, then compensate with other activities

  - Because I believe side projects, volunteering, family and exercise can actually improve work productivity
  - I prefer less strict working hours and more vacation
  - Long uninterrupted time of focused work is essential

- Safe environment to fail

  - I like systems where you can fix your previous mistakes
  - I like relationships where forgiveness is possible

- Use of agile methodologies

  - An ability to make a change is advantage to both a creator and his customer
  - Continuous attention to technical excelence and good design is enhances agility (from Agile manifesto)

## Questions
