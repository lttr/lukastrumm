## Inspiration

keyvalues.com is a great website with a list of values that one might appreciate.

## My values

- Free time over pointless work
  - Because I believe side projects, volunteering, family and exercise can actually improve work productivity
  - I prefer less strict working hours and more vacation

## Questions

- What is a typical way of letting others know that I need one day off or I need to shift my work a couple of hours. I had to deal with those things a lot when we were building our house.
- Is it possible to do all of the work from a Linux machine? I like my PopOS a lot.
