## Inspiration

keyvalues.com is a great website with a list of values that one might appreciate.

## My values

- Ownership and responsibility

- Open communication, open software

  - I like clear, constructive and open communication
  - I like when software is done similarly&mdash;it is open source and open to contribution (or at least internally)

- Friendly to parents

- Focus on work, then compensate with other activities

  - Because I believe side projects, volunteering, family and exercise can actually improve work productivity
  - I prefer less strict working hours and more vacation

## Questions

- Can you walk me through your development process, from a ticket or task to code on production?
- How often are engineers expected to provide status updates on a project?
- What is a typical way of letting others know that I need one day off or I need to shift my work a couple of hours. I had to deal with those things a lot when we were building our house.
- Is it possible to do all of the work from a Linux machine? I like my PopOS a lot.
