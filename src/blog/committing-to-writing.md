I have been struggling with writing regularly for quite some time. I wanted to write more, publish blog posts and I'm even dreaming about writing a book it the future.

---

As usual I am procrastinating this activity a big time. Until today. I finally feel confident in ability to write something, write something several times every week and stick to it for some time.

I have a feeling that I recognize. I have been there before. It is a feeling where all prerequisites are satisfied and you are ready. I had that feeling when I started running almost every day. And that was successful, I still run several times a week ten years later.

There have been a number of reasons to write periodically for me. But looking at my website I struggle: 10 posts in 4 years. Better than nothing, maybe.

So, the reasons:

- writing force you to shape your ideas
- publishing ideas make it easy to share them
- publishing ideas make it easy to archive them
- others can _see_ what you know
- writing itself puts you in a great state of flow

There might be more reasons but this is enough. Every point on this list is big by itself.

Now what are the prerequisites? Why do I feel confident, that I will be able to write consistently?

- I have stable working schedule, and specifically I am able to start with my day early in the morning when it is a great time for writing.
- I have a lot of ideas. Every week I tell myself that I should write about something.
- I have some confidence that it is worth it. This is a classical problem --- everything have been already written on the internet --- so why should I bother.
- I have a publishing workflow. Write markdown, commit and push. Easy, isn't it. My favourite editor for writing right now is Obsidian with vim keybindings. I like the semi-wysiwyg way of writing markdown. Also, I already write markdown notes several times a week.
- I believe I know enough english to form the ideas I have in mind.

Only time can tell whether I will be successful. But I can thank a few people already:

About the importance of blogging and owning your content I have learned from [Scott Hanselman](https://www.hanselman.com/blog).

From [Swyx](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public) I have learned about _learning in public_ and being curious about various web technologies.

I have studied some ways of writing in a more aproachable way, e.g. on [writy.io](https://writy.io) by Maedah Batool.

And most recently I have read a great article about writing from a leading Czech frontend engineer Martin Mich√°lek on https://www.vzhurudolu.cz/prirucka/psani.
