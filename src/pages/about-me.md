I love doing work that brings joy to everyone involved. I love my family. I love being alone and improving my craft.

I strongly believe in the principles of the Scout movement. Software engineering craftsmanship is an area of my big interest in which I strive to do a professional job. It is a _duty to myself_ to excel in my profession.

I am leader of local scout group. We actively participate on positive change of our world through young generation. I feel that it is (alongside with care for our families) the best form of _duty to others_ I am able to provide.

I love running in the nature. In difficult (inspiring) conditions one can come up with things that would otherwise remain hidden. Asking yourself whether you are on the right lifeway is essential for the _duty to God_.
