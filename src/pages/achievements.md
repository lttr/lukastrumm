# Achievements

_These are not accomplishments to show me off. This is only a list that motivates me to keep doing interesting things. It is in random order._

- I have used vim as my main editor.
- I have spent whole night &mdash; no sleep &mdash; fixing broken servers.
- I have made a fire by rubbing wood.
- With my wife we built a house.
- I have spent more then a year of my life at scout camps.
