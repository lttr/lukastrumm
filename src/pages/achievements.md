_These are not accomplishments to show me off. This is only a list that motivates me to keep doing interesting things. It is in random order._

- I walked across a rope without aids.
- I have used vim as my main editor.
- I spent whole night&mdash;no sleep&mdash;fixing broken servers.
- I made a fire by rubbing wood.
- With my wife we built a house.
- I have spent more then a year of my life at scout camps.
- I have spent too much time watching Starcraft videos. I have learned English by doing so.
- I have completed a vision quest. Four days and four nights in a forest without other people, electronics, food. Only with my mind.
- I have set my annual goals for every year for 10 consecutive years.
- My wife has told me several times that I am such a great dad to our children.
