I am Lukas Trumm, software developer, scout leader and mountain runner.

This is my personal site, however I try to add content useful for others. Sections about software development are written in English, the section about scouting is in my first language - Czech. I hope it will be more useful this way.

I strongly believe in the principles of the Scout movement. Software engineering craftsmanship is an area of my big interest in which I strive to do a professional job. It is a _duty to myself_ to excel in my profession. 

I am leader of local scout group. We actively participate on positive change of our world through young generation. I feel that it is (alongside with care for our families) the best form of _duty to others_ I am able to provide.

I love running in the nature. In difficult (but inspiring) conditions one can come up with things that would otherwise remain hidden. Asking yourself whether you are on the right way is essential for the _duty to God_.
