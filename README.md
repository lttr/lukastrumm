[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/907021ec-61b6-42ba-ac7e-c1740214bddd/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/lukastrumm/deploys)

This is my personal website.

It is built using [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) and deployed to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

## How does it work

A bunch of markdown and javascript files are processed and spits out a bunch of html files.

Develop

```
npm start
```

Build for production

```
npm run build
```

## Features

Markdown rendering features are showcased in [this blog post](https://lukastrumm.com/blog/2020/markdown-capabilities-in-eleventy/).
